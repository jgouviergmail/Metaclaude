# Changelog

All notable changes to Metaclaude. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org). Each entry links the commit that carries the full
story — the commit messages in this repository are written to be read.

This file is part of the product surface: the in-app changelog renders from it,
and Metaclaude maintains it as part of shipping a change (see docs/ROADMAP.md,
"The system that documents itself").

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Adopt the CLI's own sessions.** The workspace page can now list every
  conversation the Claude CLI holds for that directory — terminal sessions
  included — and adopt one into Metaclaude, after which resuming, steering
  and accounting work as for a native session. Adoption trusts only the CLI's
  own listing: an id the CLI does not name for that directory is refused, so
  a request cannot bind a session from some other directory; and a session
  already adopted is offered as *Open*, never adopted twice.
- **Help, inside the product.** A Help screen fed from the repository rather
  than from strings in the code: the user guide (`docs/guide/`, nine chapters,
  bundled per-chapter as lazy chunks), this changelog, and search that treats
  a two-word query as one question. "Ask Metaclaude about itself" opens a
  plan-mode session in a workspace seeded with the same guide — the assistant
  answers from the pages you are reading, with citations, and can execute
  nothing.
- **Documentation that cannot drift.** The deploy checks now fail when the
  running version has no changelog entry, when the guide names a setting that
  does not exist, or when any documented log line stops existing in the code.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-26

The first version deployed to a real server, reachable at a real domain with a
publicly trusted certificate, and driven to green through a full reinstall
rehearsed end to end.

### Added

- **The agentic core.** Sessions with streaming transcripts, tool-call cards,
  permission prompts showing the literal command, plan checklists, inline
  diffs, and per-run cost accounting. Runs are steerable mid-flight: the SDK
  `Query` handle is held, so follow-ups, model switches and clean interrupts
  reach a live run.
- **Ultracode.** Per-message multi-agent orchestration — one toggle in the
  composer fans the message out across sub-agents at maximum effort. Offered
  only when the chosen model reports `xhigh`; never a stored default, never
  chosen by the learner: orchestration multiplies token spend, so only a
  per-message human choice may switch it on.
- **Learning.** Three-kind memory (episodic, semantic, procedural) with hybrid
  retrieval — dense vectors plus BM25 under an absolute relevance floor, fused
  by reciprocal rank. A Thompson-sampling bandit picks model and effort per
  task category; reflexion extracts durable lessons; everything inspectable
  and resettable from Analytics.
- **Rewind.** Any finished run can be undone through the CLI's own file
  checkpointing, with a dry-run preview of exactly which files would change.
- **Agent Plugins 1.0.0.** A conformant loader for the vendor-neutral plugin
  format: skills, agents, MCP servers, per-component isolation, and the
  `.data` reservation honoured.
- **Security.** Argon-free scrypt password hashing, single-use TOTP with QR
  enrolment and recovery codes, race-free second-factor consumption (the
  write is the check), an AES-256-GCM vault for MCP secrets, an append-only
  hash-chained audit log, path jailing with realpath resolution, and a
  workspaces root that may not contain — or be contained by — the data
  directory holding the master key.
- **Deployment.** One-command bootstrap on a hardened host (accounts, sshd,
  ufw with the Docker bypass closed on v4 *and* v6, fail2ban, dead man's
  switch against lockouts). Five TLS modes including a Let's Encrypt staging
  rehearsal so iterating cannot burn the five-per-week quota. CI builds and
  attests the image; deploys are tag-driven, health-gated, and roll back on
  their own. An uninstaller that keeps your data unless told twice not to.
- **Self-checks.** 1,240 tests; 72 deploy assertions that rehearse the
  uninstaller against a real daemon, validate every TLS mode with Caddy
  itself, and verify that every log line the documentation says to grep for
  is one the code still writes.

### Fixed

- A run never ended: streaming input left the SDK generator waiting for a
  close that only arrived at the 45-minute timeout. The test double had been
  ending the stream on its own — more helpful than the SDK it doubled — which
  is how 47 green tests certified a supervisor that hung on every run.
- The proxy leaked one task per healthcheck probe (no reaper as PID 1) and
  read `unhealthy` forever after ~5 hours while serving perfectly. Found on
  the live deployment at 3,643 tasks of a 3,647 ceiling; `init: true`, plus a
  deploy assertion that no probed service ships without a reaper.
- Moving the workspaces root stranded every workspace row at its old path,
  which read as data loss while the files sat untouched. Rows whose directory
  is named after their slug are re-pointed at boot; the rest are reported.
- Two authentication races (concurrent logins sharing one TOTP code or one
  recovery code), a symlink escape past the directory grants, and a lexical
  retrieval gate that admitted the whole corpus when every score was noise.
